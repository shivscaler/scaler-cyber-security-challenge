You are conducting a penetration test on a web application and discover that it has a login form vulnerable to SQL injection. You successfully exploit the vulnerability and extract the usernames and hashed passwords from the database. However, when you try to crack the hashed passwords using an offline brute-force attack, you find that it takes an unusually long time to crack them. What might be the reason for this delay, and how could you improve the password cracking speed?
